				<h5> Data Sets</h5>
				<p> Our data is separated into four categories:
				<ul>
					<li> <a href="/data/index.php#ed">Election Data (ED):</a> Contains data that either was an election, or can be interpreted as election data. We have data from actual elections, movie rankings, and competitor rankings from various sporting competitions.</li>
					<li><a href="/data/index.php#md">Matching Data (MD):</a> Contains data where agents express preference over items (and vise-verse) in order to pair agents to items.  Currently, we only have synthetic data from organ and kidney matching in the USA.</li>
					<li><a href="/data/index.php#cd">Rating and Combinatorial Preference Data (CD):</a> Contains data from a broad set of domains that can be viewed as combinatorial and/or multidimensional including multi-attribute ratings, CP-nets, and GAI-nets. </li>
					<li><a href="/data/index.php#od">Optimization Data (OD):</a> Contain data that is typically associated with optimization problems including SAT and CSP problems.</li>
				</p>

				<p> Each data file we host has a unique identifier in the format [XX]-#####-########.EXT.  These numbers are broken down as:
				<ul>
					<li>XX is a 2 letter category code from above. </li>
					<li>##### is a 5 digit Series Code which specifies the source of the data. </li>
					<li>######## is an 8 digit Element Number for each individual file of a series.
					<li>EXT which is a unique <a href="./data/format.php">file extension</a> describing the type of data in the file.
				</ul>
				</p>

				<p> Each data file is labeled as either Original, Induced, or Imbued.
				<ul>
					<li><b>Original:</b> Data that has only been converted into our formatting.</li>
					<li><b>Induced:</b> Data that has been induced from another context.  For example, computing a pairwise relation form a set of strict total orders.  No assumptions have been made to create these files, just a change in the expression language.</li>
					<li><b>Imbued:</b> Data that has been imbued with extra information.  For example, extending an incomplete partial order by placing all unranked candidates tied at the end.</li>
				</ul>
				We encourage you to understand some of the impacts that making these assumptions can have, see, e.g. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=A+Behavioral+Perspective+on+Social+Choice">A Behavioral Perspective on Social Choice.</a>  Anna Popova, Michel Regenwetter, and Nicholas Mattei.
